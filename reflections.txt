Your response goes here!



* What new skills have you learned?

	I think I am developing my internal dictionary of properties and attributes. I had to research some elements I did not know, and I am trying
	to commit those to memory in order to be faster.

* What has been easy?

	Overall I think the concept was fairly easy, and general implementation seemed so too.

* What has been difficult?

	I think focusing on the small details of replicating the mock up exactly was a little difficult. But it's great practice.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

	I have definitely taken advantage of googling and looking at web developer tools. I feel like I am getting better at asking the right questions
	on google and on the dev tools sites.
